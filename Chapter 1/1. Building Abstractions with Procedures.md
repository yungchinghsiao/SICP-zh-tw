以程序作為建立抽象的基石
===================

> The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 1. Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 2. The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 3. The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.

> John Locke, An Essay Concerning Human Understanding (1690)

> 人的心智活動透過簡單的概念而發揮它的力量，方法主要可分為三種:
> 第一，把數個簡單的概念組合成一個複合的概念，於是所有複雜的概念成焉。
> 第二，將兩個概念，不論簡單或複雜，不將它們結合，而是同時並列在一起觀察，如此就能得知何為相互關聯。
> 第三，把某些概念，與伴隨它們其他真實存在的概念區隔出來，這稱為**抽象化**，所有一般化、概化的概念皆是由此而生。

We are about to study the idea of a computational process. Computational processes are abstract beings that inhabit computers. As they evolve, processes manipulate other abstract things called data. The evolution of a process is directed by a pattern of rules called a program. People create programs to direct processes. In effect, we conjure the spirits of the computer with our spells.

我們打算要學習 **計算程序 (computational process)**。 計算程序是居住在計算機裡的抽象存在，計算程序操控著另一種稱作數據的抽象物體，而計算程序本身則是受到一種叫做 **程式 (program)** 的模式規則所控制。人們寫程式來指示計算程序，實際上就像我們下達魔法咒語控制計算機的靈魂。

A computational process is indeed much like a sorcerer's idea of a spirit. It cannot be seen or touched. It is not composed of matter at all. However, it is very real. It can perform intellectual work. It can answer questions. It can affect the world by disbursing money at a bank or by controlling a robot arm in a factory. The programs we use to conjure processes are like a sorcerer's spells. They are carefully composed from symbolic expressions in arcane and esoteric programming languages that prescribe the tasks we want our processes to perform.

計算程序確實像極了魔法師一類的事，它既看不見也摸不著，也不是以物質組成的。然而，它的卻非常真實，它能做需要智力的工作
，回答問題，在銀行裡支付金錢，或者在工廠裡控制著機械手臂來影響世界。我們用以驅使計算程序的的程式就像是魔法師的咒語一樣。我們用神秘又深奧的程式語言，小心翼翼地組成一些符號語句以規範我們要計算程序執行的工作。

A computational process, in a correctly working computer, executes programs precisely and accurately. Thus, like the sorcerer's apprentice, novice programmers must learn to understand and to anticipate the consequences of their conjuring. Even small errors (usually called bugs or glitches) in programs can have complex and unanticipated consequences.

正常運轉的計算機裡，計算程序總是分毫不差地精準地執行程式工作。因此菜鳥程式員，如同見習魔法師一樣必須學習去了解並且預期施展魔法咒語的後果。即使僅僅是程式裡的小錯誤 (通常叫臭蟲或故障) 也會造成複雜而無法預料的結果。

Fortunately, learning to program is considerably less dangerous than learning sorcery, because the spirits we deal with are conveniently contained in a secure way. Real-world programming, however, requires care, expertise, and wisdom. A small bug in a computer-aided design program, for example, can lead to the catastrophic collapse of an airplane or a dam or the self-destruction of an industrial robot.

幸好學習寫程式比學魔法咒語安全多了，我們應付的鬼靈們安全又冷靜。然而真實世界裡的程式設計依舊需要細心、專業知識和智慧。舉例來說，一個在計算機輔助設計系統裡的小小 Bug ，可能導致飛機或水壩災難性的損毀或者工業機器人自爆。

Master software engineers have the ability to organize programs so that they can be reasonably sure that the resulting processes will perform the tasks intended. They can visualize the behavior of their systems in advance. They know how to structure programs so that unanticipated problems do not lead to catastrophic consequences, and when problems do arise, they can debug their programs. Well-designed computational systems, like well-designed automobiles or nuclear reactors, are designed in a modular manner, so that the parts can be constructed, replaced, and debugged separately.

軟體工程大師有組織程式的能力，所以他們確信計算程序執行的工作結果符合預期。他們有辦法預先看見系統的行為，知道怎麼建構程式才不會使預料外的問題造成災難，而且當問題發生時，他們能替程式除錯。設計良好的計算機系統，就像設計良好的車子或核子反應爐，是用模組化的方式設計的，因此總能分別地對每個子系統建構、替換、和除錯。


用 Lisp 寫程式
----------------------------

 We need an appropriate language for describing processes, and we will use for this purpose the programming language Lisp. Just as our everyday thoughts are usually expressed in our natural language (such as English, French, or Japanese), and descriptions of quantitative phenomena are expressed with mathematical notations, our procedural thoughts will be expressed in Lisp. Lisp was invented in the late 1950s as a formalism for reasoning about the use of certain kinds of logical expressions, called recursion equations, as a model for computation. The language was conceived by John McCarthy and is based on his paper ``Recursive Functions of Symbolic Expressions and Their Computation by Machine'' (McCarthy 1960).
 
我們需要一個描述計算程序的恰當語言，為此我們採用 Lisp 程式語言。 就像我們用自然語言(如英語、法語或日語) 來表達日常所思所想，用數學符號來描述定量現象一樣，我們也用 Lisp 來描述有關計算程序的想法。 Lisp 發明於 1950 年代末， 是為了對一種特別的邏輯運算式(我們稱之為遞迴式)進行推理，作一種計算模型。 Lisp 語言是由 John McCarthy 這位仁兄所構思出來的，根據他的論文『遞迴函式的符號表達式以及由機器運算的方式』 (McCarthy 1960)。

Despite its inception as a mathematical formalism, Lisp is a practical programming language. A Lisp interpreter is a machine that carries out processes described in the Lisp language. The first Lisp interpreter was implemented by McCarthy with the help of colleagues and students in the Artificial Intelligence Group of the MIT Research Laboratory of Electronics and in the MIT Computation Center. Lisp, whose name is an acronym for LISt Processing, was designed to provide symbol-manipulating capabilities for attacking programming problems such as the symbolic differentiation and integration of algebraic expressions. It included for this purpose new data objects known as atoms and lists, which most strikingly set it apart from all other languages of the period.

Lisp 除了起初描述數學形式的目的，它也是個實用的程式語言。 Lisp 解釋器是一個能執行 Lisp 語言寫的計算程序的機器。歷史上第一個 Lisp 解釋器，是在麻省理工學院計算中心的電子研究室裡，由  McCarthy 與人工智慧小組的同事學生們的協助下實現的。 Lisp 是 LISt Processing  的縮寫 (意思是列表處理)。 Lisp 設計之初即具備符號處理的能力，能用於解決一些像對代數式做符號微分和積分的程式問題。Lisp 包括了一些叫做 Atoms 和 Lists 的嶄新資料物件，這使它迴異於過去的其他程式語言。

Lisp was not the product of a concerted design effort. Instead, it evolved informally in an experimental manner in response to users' needs and to pragmatic implementation considerations. Lisp's informal evolution has continued through the years, and the community of Lisp users has traditionally resisted attempts to promulgate any ``official'' definition of the language. This evolution, together with the flexibility and elegance of the initial conception, has enabled Lisp, which is the second oldest language in widespread use today (only Fortran is older), to continually adapt to encompass the most modern ideas about program design. Thus, Lisp is by now a family of dialects, which, while sharing most of the original features, may differ from one another in significant ways. The dialect of Lisp used in this book is called Scheme. 2

Lisp 並不是一個精心設計的成果，相反地，它是循著用戶需求的反饋和實用上的考量，以一種實驗性質的方式逐漸地演化而成的。Lisp 的非正式演化已經持續了多年，而且 Lisp 社群傳統上刻意的抗拒去頒布一個官方正式定義的 Lisp 語言。 伴隨著 Lisp 最初構想的彈性和優雅，演化使得 Lisp 這個世界上第二老的語言 (目前尚且廣為使用的語言只有 Fortran 比它老)  得以不斷的適應最新的程式設計概念。因此現今的 Lisp 其實是一個有許多方言的語言家族，這個家族的成員共享 Lisp 的最初構想，但是可能在許多地方明顯不同。 本書所採用的 Lisp 方言叫做 Scheme 。

 Because of its experimental character and its emphasis on symbol manipulation, Lisp was at first very inefficient for numerical computations, at least in comparison with Fortran. Over the years, however, Lisp compilers have been developed that translate programs into machine code that can perform numerical computations reasonably efficiently. And for special applications, Lisp has been used with great effectiveness.3 Although Lisp has not yet overcome its old reputation as hopelessly inefficient, Lisp is now used in many applications where efficiency is not the central concern. For example, Lisp has become a language of choice for operating-system shell languages and for extension languages for editors and computer-aided design systems.
 
Lisp 一開始因為其實驗性格和著重符號處理，它的數字運算非常慢，至少跟 Fortran 比是如此。但是 Lisp 編譯器經過了許多年 的發展，現在從源碼轉換而成的機器碼已經有了合理的運算效率。在某些特殊領域的應用 Lisp 發揮了巨大的成效。雖然 Lisp 還沒完全擺脫過去低效的臭名，但現在已經有許多效能非首要考量的應用採用了 Lisp 。比方說作業系統的 Shell 語言，編輯器擴充插件或計算機輔助設計系統，Lisp 都是選項之一。 

If Lisp is not a mainstream language, why are we using it as the framework for our discussion of programming? Because the language possesses unique features that make it an excellent medium for studying important programming constructs and data structures and for relating them to the linguistic features that support them. The most significant of these features is the fact that Lisp descriptions of processes, called procedures, can themselves be represented and manipulated as Lisp data. The importance of this is that there are powerful program-design techniques that rely on the ability to blur the traditional distinction between **passive** data and **active** processes. As we shall discover, Lisp's flexibility in handling procedures as data makes it one of the most convenient languages in existence for exploring these techniques. The ability to represent procedures as data also makes Lisp an excellent language for writing programs that must manipulate other programs as data, such as the interpreters and compilers that support computer languages. Above and beyond these considerations, programming in Lisp is great fun.

既然 Lisp 並非一門主流語言，為什麼本書仍要以其作為討論程式設計的框架呢？因為 Lisp 擁有的獨一無二的語言特性使其成為一門優秀的學習重要的程式設計基礎和數據結構的媒介並能使程序員將編程基礎及數據結構與 Lisp 的語言特性緊密結合。其中最重要的特性是所謂的 procedure，即在 Lisp 程序中被描述的過程，其本身可以作為 Lisp 數據進行操作。個中的重要性是在於強大的程式設計方法模糊了傳統觀念中被動的數據和主動的過程之間的界限。正如我們將通過本書探索到的， Lisp 如數據一般操作過程的靈活性使得之成為探索這種程式設計方法的最便捷的語言之一。將過程表現為數據的特性亦使得 Lisp 能夠寫出將其他程式視為數據並進行操作的程式，如處理計算機語言的解釋器和編譯器，而成為一門傑出的程式設計語言。不僅僅基於以上這些優點，使用 Lisp 語言編寫程式，充滿樂趣。
